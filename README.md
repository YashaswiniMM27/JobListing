- **Job Details View**: Clicking on a job listing navigates the user to a detailed view of that job.
- **Job Application**: Users can apply to jobs directly via a job application form.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Custom Styling**: Custom CSS is used to style the job listing page, pagination, and job details.
